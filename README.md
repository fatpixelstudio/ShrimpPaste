Shrimp Paste
========

Shrimp Paste is a very basic javascript slider.

This slider is in a proof-of-concept stage. Not ready for production yet, and many, many, options have to be implemented.

## The idea

The Shrimp Paste javascript slider is the slider that only provides the functionality of a javascript slider.

The styling, markup and whatnot is totally up to you.

Because almost every slider or carousel is packed with options and stylesheets, I decided to create Shrimp Paste. The goal is to keep this as basic as possible, so customizing is no hassle.
