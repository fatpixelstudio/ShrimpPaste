ShrimpPaste
========

ShrimpPaste is a very basic javascript lightbox (or modal).

No dependencies, no libraries, just a lightbox. Suitable for the developer that wants to extend / modify it for specific needs.

## The idea

When searching for basic lightboxes or modals, I found almost all solutions are based on libraries like jQuery. Or they are packed with options and stylesheets.

When writing a basic lightbox for the umteenth time, I decided to create Shrimp Paste. The goal is to keep this as basic as possible, so customizing is no hassle.
